World Anvil
This tool establishes the foundational world for the story. When crafting a detailed and immersive world, consider the following fundamental aspects:
World Name: This is the foundational identifier for your creation. It should be memorable, evocative, and ideally, hint at the world's nature or central themes. A compelling name can instantly convey tone, genre, and even a sense of its history or unique characteristics.
Core Premise / High Concept: This serves as the elevator pitch for your world. It's a concise, one-sentence summary that encapsulates the central idea, the unique hook, or the defining conflict that drives its existence. A strong high concept is crucial for quickly communicating the essence of your world to others and for maintaining focus during development.
Major Factions & Powers: These are the significant organized groups, influential individuals, and dominant forces that shape the political, social, and economic landscape of your world. This includes, but is not limited to, powerful guilds, established kingdoms, formidable empires, secretive cabals, ubiquitous corporations, or even ancient, sentient races. Understanding their motivations, power dynamics, and interrelationships is vital for creating a dynamic and believable setting.
History & Lore Timeline: This comprises the chronological sequence of significant events that have shaped your world, from its primordial origins to the current day. It includes ancient myths, legendary figures, pivotal wars, groundbreaking discoveries, and periods of both prosperity and decline. A well-developed history provides depth, explains the current state of affairs, and offers rich material for storytelling and character development.
Cosmology & Unique Physics: This delves into the fundamental rules and underlying structure of your world. It encompasses magic systems, if present, detailing their sources, limitations, and applications. It also defines the fundamental laws of nature that govern existence within your world, which might deviate significantly from real-world physics. This could include unique scientific principles, esoteric energy sources, or even divine interventions that influence the very fabric of reality. This element dictates what is possible and impossible within your world, providing a consistent framework for all events and phenomena.
