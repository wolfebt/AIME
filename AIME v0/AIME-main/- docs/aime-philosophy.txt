Philosophy Scribe 
This tool is for creating religions, belief systems, or societal philosophies.
Name: This section should clearly and concisely state the official or commonly recognized name of the belief system being described. It is the primary identifier for the philosophical or religious framework under discussion.
Core Tenets & Beliefs: This crucial section delves into the foundational principles, doctrines, and worldview that define the philosophy or religion. It should articulate the central ideas about existence, divinity (if applicable), humanity's place in the universe, morality, and the nature of reality. This includes outlining fundamental truths, ethical guidelines, and perspectives on the ultimate purpose of life.
Rituals & Practices: This part focuses on the observable expressions of the belief system. It details the significant ceremonies, traditions, and regular activities performed by adherents. This can encompass a wide range of practices, such as worship services, prayers, meditations, rites of passage (e.g., birth, marriage, death), annual holidays, pilgrimages, and dietary laws. The description should convey the meaning and significance of these rituals within the context of the belief system.
Symbols & Iconography: This section explores the visual and tangible representations that hold sacred or significant meaning within the philosophy or religion. It includes key images, emblems, sacred objects, artistic motifs, and representative marks that serve as powerful identifiers or convey abstract concepts. Examples might include specific architectural styles, clothing, musical instruments, or natural elements that are imbued with symbolic weight.
Influence & Role in Society: This final section examines the broader impact and function of the belief system within human society. It explores how the philosophy or religion has shaped, and continues to shape, various aspects of culture, including legal systems, moral codes, artistic expressions, social structures, educational practices, scientific inquiry, and daily human interactions. This analysis should consider both historical and contemporary influence.
