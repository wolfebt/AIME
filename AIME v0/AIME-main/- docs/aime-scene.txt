Scene Builder 
This tool is for constructing individual scenes. Important props or elements that characters can interact with.
Scene Name / Slugline: This is the formal identifier for the scene, often presented in a screenplay-style slugline. It provides a quick overview of the scene's setting and time of day. For example, "INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY" indicates an interior scene within a coffee shop during daytime hours. This helps in organizing and navigating a larger narrative.
Location: A precise and descriptive account of where the scene unfolds. This goes beyond a simple name and might include details like "a bustling independent coffee shop with mismatched furniture and a strong aroma of roasted beans" or "a quiet, dimly lit corner booth in an upscale restaurant." The specificity helps to ground the reader or viewer in the environment.
Sensory Details: This section focuses on engaging all five senses to bring the scene to life.
Sight: What is visible within the scene? This could include details about lighting, colors, objects, character appearances, and visual cues that convey emotion or information.
Sound: What can be heard? This might range from dialogue and sound effects (e.g., clinking of cups, distant traffic, background music) to the subtle nuances of silence.
Smell: What are the prominent scents in the environment? A coffee shop might have the rich aroma of coffee, pastries, or even cleaning supplies. A forest scene could carry the scent of pine and damp earth.
Touch/Feel: What is the tactile experience of the scene? This could involve descriptions of temperature (e.g., a warm breeze, a cold metal railing), textures (e.g., rough wood, smooth silk), or physical sensations (e.g., the vibration of a passing train).
Mood & Atmosphere: This element captures the overall emotional and psychological tone of the scene. Is it tense, humorous, melancholic, joyful, mysterious, or suspenseful? The atmosphere is created through a combination of lighting, sound, character actions, and even the weather. For instance, a dark, rainy night can inherently suggest a somber or suspenseful mood.
Key Objects & Interactivity: This section lists important props or elements within the scene that characters can directly engage with. These objects are not merely decorative but serve a purpose in the narrative or character development. Examples include a specific book a character is reading, a mysterious antique box, a ringing telephone, a weapon, or even a piece of furniture that facilitates an action (e.g., a chair that collapses). The potential for interaction with these objects often drives plot points or reveals character traits.
