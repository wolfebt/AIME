Species Creator 
This tool is for designing different species or creatures. To effectively document and understand any given species, a comprehensive profile is essential. This guide outlines the key categories for a detailed species profile, ensuring all crucial information is captured.
Species Name: Begin with the formal, recognized name of the species. This should be clear and unambiguous, potentially including both common and scientific nomenclature if applicable.
Classification: Provide a precise categorization for the species. This helps to group it within a broader biological or ecological framework. Examples include, but are not limited to, "Sentient Mammal," "Silicon-based Flora," "Avian Predator," or "Aquatic Invertebrate." This classification aids in understanding its fundamental nature and place in the grand scheme of life.
Physical Description: Offer a thorough and detailed description of the species' physical characteristics. This section should cover its overall appearance, including size, shape, coloration, and distinguishing features. Furthermore, delve into its fundamental biology, discussing its internal systems, unique adaptations, and any remarkable biological processes. Finally, outline its life cycle, from birth or inception through maturity, reproduction, and eventual demise, including significant developmental stages and average lifespan.
Abilities & Powers: Document any special traits, unique skills, or natural defenses possessed by the species. This could range from advanced cognitive abilities, psychic powers, or technological aptitude to remarkable physiological adaptations like camouflage, venom production, or extraordinary strength. Include any unique sensory perceptions or communication methods.
Behavior & Diet: Describe the species' social structure, detailing whether they are solitary, pack-oriented, hive-minded, or otherwise communal. Discuss their typical temperament, including aggression levels, intelligence, and emotional range. This section should also explicitly state their food sources and dietary habits, whether they are herbivores, carnivores, omnivores, saprophytes, or derive sustenance through other means.
Habitat & Origin: Identify their native environment, specifying the geographical location, climate, and ecological niche they occupy. Provide insight into their evolutionary history, discussing their origins, ancestral forms, and any significant evolutionary milestones or adaptations that led to their current form.
**Role in the World: Finally, describe how the species integrates into and influences its broader ecosystem or society. This includes their ecological impact (e.g., as a keystone species, pest, or pollinator) and their societal role if they are sentient (e.g., as builders, artists, warriors, or a subjugated class). This section contextualizes the species within the larger narrative of the world it inhabits.
