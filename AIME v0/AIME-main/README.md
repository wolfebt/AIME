## The Art of AI Crafting

AIME is built on the philosophy of "AI Craft," a collaborative and intentional approach to creating with AI. This approach treats the AI as a creative partner, not a content factory. The writer acts as a director, editor, and visionary, using the AI as an infinitely skilled but obedient assistant to bring a unique vision to life.

### Core Principles of AI Craft

1.  **The Seed is Everything (Intentional Input):** The quality of your output is directly proportional to the quality of your input. Provide the AI with a rich "seed" of context, including your unique premise, character motivations, setting details, and desired tone.
2.  **The First Draft is a Lie (Iterative Refinement):** Never accept the first output as final. Think of it as a brainstorming session. Your job is to identify the strong parts, discard the weak, and guide the AI on the next iteration.
3.  **Breathe Life into the Machine (Humanization):** An AI can assemble words, but only you can give them a soul. The most crucial step is the human touch: rewriting a sentence to fit your character's voice, adding a specific sensory detail from your own memory, or adjusting the pacing to build suspense.
4.  **You are the Curator (Ethical Creation):** The AI has no taste or ethics. You are the final filter. It is your responsibility to ensure the story is coherent, the themes are meaningful, and the content aligns with your creative and moral standards.

By embracing the principles of AI Craft, you elevate your role from a mere user of a tool to a true artisan of a new creative medium, ensuring that your stories remain uniquely and powerfully human.
